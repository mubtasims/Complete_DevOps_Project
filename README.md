# Complete-DevOps Project

This project showcases a complete CI/CD structure of a DevOps project end to end, portraying the transition of codes from developing stage to production.
In this project, a Jave based code has been developed by software engineers and is pushed into a git repositiory. GitHub, which is a source code management tool is used for this project which is then connected to Jenkins, a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and after the build stage has been completed, it generates an artifact. This artifact is later deployed into a target environment. 

This project consists of scripts required to create a fully working CI/CD architecture of a Java web app.
